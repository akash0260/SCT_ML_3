This repository contains a machine learning model that classifies images of cats and dogs. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model learns to differentiate between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. It is based on supervised learning, using labeled images for training and testing.

Features
Image Classification: Classifies images into either 'cat' or 'dog' categories.
Pretrained Model: Includes a pretrained model for inference.
Customizable: Can be fine-tuned with your own dataset to improve accuracy.
Real-time Classification: Supports image and real-time video classification using a webcam.
